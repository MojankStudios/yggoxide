# Mojank Studios

> Putting the jank in Mojank

This is a project to build an alternative decentralised authentication service for Minecraft out of the reach of Microsoft and Mojang.

## What's going on with chat reporting?

If you want a quick rundown of everything, you should watch FitMC's video on the topic, it is quite well researched and gives you an idea of the drawbacks of the new reporting system.

## Is this legal?

To briefly summarise:

- We are not distributing any of Mojang's code.
- We are not allowing people to pirate the game.

  (the burden is on the launchers that choose to use this system to validate the player owns the game)
- Mojang goes one step further and allows users to disable authentication completely on their servers.
- Mojang does not disallow and actually encourages modifications to Minecraft.
- This is an implementation of publicly available information from sources such as https://wiki.vg.

TL;DR lol who knows im not a lawyer
